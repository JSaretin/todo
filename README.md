# An awesome todo app

So everyone is talking about creating a todo app, I didn't really give it much attention, so this weekend I decided to finally make a simply todo site where user can write their a todo, the writen todo will be saved to the browser localstorage and the user will be able to edit, delete and change the complete status of the todo.

I created this todo app using HTML, SCSS and vanilla JavaScript. I hope to add more fuctionality to this project, this proccess has been fun for me, so I have decided to add some uniqe features.
